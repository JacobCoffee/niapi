Contribution guide
==================

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

1. Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_
2. Run ``poetry install`` to create a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ and install
   the dependencies
3. If you're working on the documentation and need to build it locally, install the extra dependencies with ``poetry install --with docs``
4. Install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_
5. Run ``pre-commit install`` to install pre-commit hooks

.. tip::
  Many modern IDEs like PyCharm or VS Code will enable the poetry-managed virtualenv that is created in step 2 for you automatically.
  If your IDE / editor does not offer this functionality, then you will need to manually activate the virtualenv yourself. Otherwise you may encounter errors or unexpected behaviour when trying to run the commands referenced within this document.

  The easiest way to activate this virtualenv manually is by running ``poetry shell``, as described at `Using your virtual environment <https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment>`_ in poetry's documentation.

  The rest of this document will assume this environment is active wherever commands are referenced.

Workflow
++++++++

1. `Fork <https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/fork>`_ the `Litestar repository <https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar>`_
2. Clone your fork locally with git
3. `Set up the environment <#setting-up-the-environment>`_
4. Make your changes
5. (Optional) Run ``pre-commit run --all-files`` to run linters and formatters. This step is optional and will be executed
   automatically by git before you make a commit, but you may want to run it manually in order to apply fixes
6. Commit your changes to git
7. Push the changes to your fork
8. Open a `pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests>`_. Give the pull request a descriptive title
   indicating what it changes. If it has a corresponding open issue, the issue number should be included in the title as
   well. For example a pull request that fixes issue ``Bug: Increased stack size making it impossible to find needle #100``
   could be titled ``Fix #100 - Make needles easier to find by applying fire to haystack``
9. Add yourself as a contributor using the `all-contributors bot <https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage>`_


Guidelines for writing code
----------------------------

- Code should be `Pythonic and zen <https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/>`_
- All code should be fully `typed <https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/>`_. This is enforced via
  `mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_

  * When requiring complex types, use a `type alias <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases>`_.
    Check ``litestar/types`` if a type alias for your use case already exists
  * If something cannot be typed correctly due to a limitation of the type checkers, you may use
    `typing.cast <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast>`_ to rectify the situation. However, you
    should only use as a last resort if you've exhausted all other options of
    `type narrowing <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/type_narrowing.html>`_, such as
    `isinstance() <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance>`_ checks and
    `type guards <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeGuard>`_
  * You may use ``type: ignore`` if you ensured that a line is correct, but mypy / pyright has issues with it. Don't use
    blank ``type: ignore`` though, and instead supply the specific error code, e.g. ``type: ignore[attr-defined]``

- If you are adding or modifying existing code, ensure that it's fully tested. 100% test coverage is mandatory, and will
  be checked on the PR using `SonarCloud <https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/>`_
- All functions, methods, classes, and attributes should be documented with a docstring. We use the
  `Google docstring style <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_. If you come
  across a function or method that doesn't conform to this standard, please update it as you go
- When adding a new public interface, it has to be  included in the reference documentation located in
  ``docs/reference``. If applicable, add or modify examples in the docs related to the new functionality implemented,
  following the guidelines established in `Adding examples`_


Writing and running tests
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tests are contained within the ``tests`` directory, and follow the same directory structure as the ``litestar`` module.
If you are adding a test case, it should be located within the correct submodule of ``tests``. E.g. tests for
``litestar/utils/sync.py`` reside in ``tests/utils/test_sync.py``.

The ``Makefile`` includes several commands for running tests:

- ``make test`` to run tests located in ``tests``
- ``make test-examples`` to run tests located in ``docs/examples/tests``
- ``make test-all`` to run all tests
- ``make coverage`` to run tests with coverage and generate an html report


Project documentation
---------------------

The documentation is located in the ``/docs`` directory and is `ReST <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ and
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. If you're unfamiliar with any of those,
`ReStructuredText primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/lib/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ and
`Sphinx quickstart <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/lib/usage/quickstart.html>`_ are recommended reads.

Docs theme and appearance
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

We welcome contributions that enhance / improve the appearance and usability of the docs. We use the excellent
`Furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_ theme, which comes with a lot of options out of the box. If you wish to
contribute to the docs style / setup, or static site generation, you should consult the theme docs as a first step.

Running the docs locally
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To run or build the docs locally, you need to first install the required dependencies:

``poetry install --with docs``

Then you can serve the documentation with ``make docs-serve``, or build them with ``make docs``

Writing and editing docs
++++++++++++++++++++++++

We welcome contributions that enhance / improve the content of the docs. Feel free to add examples, clarify text,
restructure the docs, etc., but make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Write text in idiomatic english, using simple language
- Opt for `Oxford commas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma>`_ when listing a series of terms
- Keep examples simple and self contained
- Provide links where applicable
- Use `intersphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/lib/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html>`_ wherever possible when
  referencing external libraries
- Provide diagrams using `mermaidjs <https://mermaid.js.org/>`_ where applicable and possible

Adding examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples from the docs are located in their own modules inside the ``/docs/examples`` folder. This makes it easier
to test them alongside the rest of the test suite, ensuring they do not become stale as Litestar evolves.

Please follow the next guidelines when adding a new example:

- Add the example in the corresponding module directory in ``/docs/examples`` or create a new one if necessary
- Create a suite for the module in ``/docs/examples/tests`` that tests the aspects of the example that it demonstrates
- Reference the example in the rst file with an external reference code block, e.g.

.. code-block:: rst

    .. literalinclude:: /examples/test_thing.py
      :caption: test_thing.py
      :language: python

Automatically execute examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our docs include a Sphinx extension that can automatically run requests against example apps
and include their result in the documentation page when its being built. This only requires 2 steps:

1. Create an example file with an ``app`` object in it, which is an instance of ``Litestar``
2. Add a comment in the form of ``# run: /hello`` to the example file

When building the docs (or serving them locally), a process serving the ``app`` instance
will be launched, and the requests specified in the comments will be run against it. The
comments will be stripped from the result, and the output of the ``curl`` invocation inserted
after the example code-block.

The ``# run:`` syntax is nothing special; Everything after the colon will be passed to
the ``curl`` command that's being invoked. The URL is built automatically, so the
specified path can just be a path relative to the app.

In practice, this looks like the following:

.. code-block:: python
   :no-upgrade:

   from typing import Dict

   from litestar import Litestar, get


   @get("/")
   def hello_world() -> Dict[str, str]:
       """Handler function that returns a greeting dictionary."""
       return {"hello": "world"}


   app = Litestar(route_handlers=[hello_world])

   # run: /

This is equivalent to:


.. raw:: rst

   .. code-block:: python

       from typing import Dict

       from litestar import Litestar, get


       @get("/")
       def hello_world() -> Dict[str, str]:
           """Handler function that returns a greeting dictionary."""
           return {"hello": "world"}


       app = Litestar(route_handlers=[hello_world])


   .. admonition:: Run it

       .. code-block:: bash

           > curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
           {"hello": "world"}


Creating a new release
----------------------

1. Increment the version in ``pyproject.toml`` according to the
   `versioning scheme <https://litestar-org.github.io/litestar/latest/litestar-releases.html#version-numbering>`_
2. `Draft a new release <https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/releases/new>`_ on GitHub

   * Use ``vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` (e.g. ``v1.2.3``) as both the tag and release title
   * Fill in the release description. You can use the "Generate release notes" function to get a draft for this
3. Commit your changes and push to ``main``
4. Publish the release
5. Check that the "publish" `action <https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/actions>`_ has run successfully
